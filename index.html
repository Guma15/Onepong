                        <p>Title of research project: Narcissism, action-specific scaling effects and gameplay<br>
                        Researcher(s): Elizabeth Collier, Victoria Blinkhorn and Minna Lyons<br></p>
                        <p>In this study, we were interested in personality and speed perception in the context of gameplay. Specifically, we were interested in whether narcissism would be associated with differences in estimated speed.</p>
                        <p>The action-specific account of perception claims that what we perceive is directly affected by our action capacity.<br>
                         For example, it has been reported that balls appear to move faster when participants try to block them with a smaller paddle (Witt & Sugovic, 2010).
                         However, other evidence suggests that such effects may be the result of cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance arises when participantsâ€™ actual performance differs from their expectations of their performance.
                         For example, Wesp et al. (2004) found that participants who were poorer at throwing darts estimated the targets as smaller. This appears consistent with the action-specific account.
                         However, in a later study, Wesp and Gasper (2012) found no difference in target size estimates between better and poorer dart throwers when participants were told that the darts were of poor quality.
                         This suggests that participants in the original study estimated targets as smaller to offset the cognitive dissonance that arose between their actual and expected performance.</p>
                        <p>Narcissism is associated with an inflated sense of ability, so it might be expected that individuals scoring high on narcissism would experience greater cognitive dissonance.
                         If this is the case, then narcissism may be associated with a stronger action-specific scaling effect in the ball speed estimation task used by Witt and Sugovic (2010).
                         This is what we were testing in the present study.</p>
